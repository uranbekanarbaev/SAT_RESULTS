SAT Scores Analysis
This project includes SQL scripts to analyze SAT scores from a dataset of high schools. The analysis focuses on computing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the number of SAT test takers and their average scores in Critical Reading, Math, and Writing.

Key Features
SQL Queries: Scripts to extract and process data using SQL.
Correlation Analysis: Calculates the correlation between the number of test takers and their average SAT scores.
Data Aggregation: Uses SQL aggregation functions to compute necessary statistics for the correlation analysis.
Usage
Data Extraction: Extracts relevant columns from the SAT results dataset.
Correlation Calculation: Computes correlation coefficients for:
Number of SAT Test Takers vs. Critical Reading Avg. Score
Number of SAT Test Takers vs. Math Avg. Score
Number of SAT Test Takers vs. Writing Avg. Score
